# Day 01 – Introduction to SQL

## What is Data?
- Data can be text, numbers, images, videos, or documents
- Any raw fact or information is called data

##  What is Database?
- A database is a collection of related data
- It helps in storing and managing large amounts of data efficiently

##  What is SQL?
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL is used to interact with databases
- SQL is a query language, not a programming language

##  Why We Use SQL
- To insert data into database
- To retrieve data from database
- To update existing data
- To delete unwanted data

##  Where SQL is Used
- Data Analyst
- Data Scientist
- Business Analyst
- Data Engineer
- SQL Developer

##  Simple Shop Analogy for SQL
Imagine a clothes shop.

- The clothes shop represents a **database**.
- Different sections in the shop (shirts section, pants section) represent **tables**.
- Each individual item (one shirt, one pant) represents **data (records)**.
- The sales assistant represents the **system that manages the data**.

The sales assistant cannot understand normal human language directly.  
So, to interact with the shop data properly, we need a **special language**.

This special language is called **SQL (Structured Query Language)**.

Using SQL, we can:
- View available items
- Add new items
- Update item prices
- Remove old stock

 **Just like we talk to a sales assistant to manage shop items, we use SQL to interact with a database.**
